### todo-list-VanillaJS
https://todo-writer.netlify.app/
hello world , came up with a new todo list using vanilla javascript , html and css,Responsive in nature.
user can use this Application to write his/her todo and mark them when completed , user can also remove the todo if written by mistake.
data of the user will be saved even after closing or reloading the application.

I liked its design did you ?
use it in your daily activities to remark your achivements even smaller once.


ENJOY :)
